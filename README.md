# Descriptive-Analysis
Stats and Math Project
Descriptive Statistics is the subject matter of this project. Descriptive statistics gives us the basic summary measures about the dataset. The summary measures include measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and measures of variability (variance, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis). I have used the fortune 500 dataset from the data world website for this project.
